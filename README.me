Tournament Manager for Android

This project intends to develop a Tournament Manager, in which the user can inmput the different teams, creat a tournament with the games to be held, and keep track of the games. This track will advance the user into the next stages of the tournament and eliminate the teams depending on the score.

So far the tournament only contains an direct elimination phase, although support more types of tournaments should be added.
